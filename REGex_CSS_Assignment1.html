                <h1>SUPER MOM</h1>
Mom, you're a wonderful mother,<br>
So gentle, yet so strong.<br>
The many ways you show you care<br>
Always make me feel I belong.<br><br>

You're patient when I'm foolish;<br>
You give guidance when I ask;<br>
It seems you can do most anything;<br>
You're the master of every task.<br><br>

You're a dependable source of comfort;<br>
You're my cushion when I fall.<br>
You help in times of trouble;<br>
You support me whenever I call.<br><br>

I love you more than you know;<br>
You have my total respect.<br>
If I had my choice of mothers,<br>
You'd be the one I'd select!<br><br>
